##USER QUESTION:
What safety precautions should be taken to avoid exposure to excessive microwave energy?
====================================================================================================

?? STEP 3: GENERATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To avoid exposure to excessive microwave energy, the following safety precautions should be taken:

1. **Do not operate the microwave with the door open**: Open-door operation can result in harmful exposure to microwave energy. Do not tamper with or defeat the safety interlocks designed to prevent this.

2. **Do not attempt repairs yourself**: It is hazardous for anyone other than a trained professional to carry out service or repair operations that involve removing any cover that protects against microwave energy exposure. This includes tasks like changing the power cord or lighting. Such repairs should be handled by a service center.

3. **Keep the door and sealing surface clean**: Ensure that the door and sealing surface of the oven are clean to maintain proper functioning and prevent leakage of microwave energy.

These precautions are essential to ensure safety while using a microwave oven. [Source: RAG CONTEXT]
